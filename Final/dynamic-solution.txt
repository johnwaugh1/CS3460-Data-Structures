In order to solve the new neighbor problem dynamically, you could use
balanced binary search tree, like an AVL tree, which recorded the list
of buildings. Each node in the tree would represent a building, with the
height as a key. This tree would have efficient insertion operations that
would maintain balance, which would ensure that the time complexity would
be logarithmic for a search operation.

When a permit request is submitted, we would traverse the tree to find the
next tallest building. We would also have to consider the permits that were
submitted before the current one. To do this, we could change the BST to
store say the number of permits submitted in a nodes subtree at each node.
This lets us traverse the tree considering the effect of previous permits
on the next tallest building.
